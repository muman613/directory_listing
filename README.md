# README

This repository contains code demonstration the directory scanning 
classes. The purpose is to port this code into the `mldb` client to 
provide improved 'ls' functionality.

**NOTE:** Currently the code does not compile for both gcc and MingGW
rather there is a separate branch for the MingGW build.

## Build System

The project uses CLion as the `IDE` and `CMake` as the build system.

## Tested on

* Linux gcc
* Windows (Cygwin) gcc

## Branches

* mingw-build-branch
